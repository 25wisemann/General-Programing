// These are notes on conditionals in programing

/* A conditioal is basicaly an if and then statement
We will have more complicated examples, but all rely on the idea:
    you are checking if a condition is true, then acting based on that condition
They rely on some form of comparrison
*/

/*
Comparrisons in JavaScript look like math equations to some extent
a < b (is a less than b)
a > b (is a grater than b)
a == b (is a equal to b)
a <= b (less than or equal)
a >= b (grater tha or equal)
*/

// Examples:
let a = 5;
console.log(5 < 3);
console.log(5 > 3);
console.log(a == 5);
console.log(a == "5");

// JavaScript aslo has a tripple equal sign, for strick equality.
// Meaning that is a equal to b and have the same data type.
console.log(a === '5')
console.log(a === 5)

// the last symbol is "!"
// "!" means not
